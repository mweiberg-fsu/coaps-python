# COAPS Python Toolbelt & Tutorial
The COAPS Python Toolbelt & Tutorial is designed to get users up and running with a Python environment. Below is a list of software/IDEs that are considered industry standard. 

## Software Utilized
- **Anaconda** - Python distribution for data science with built-in package management.
- **Visual Studio Code** - Versatile code editor with debugging and extension support.
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive tool for writing and running code with visuals and notes.
- **GitHub Copilot** - AI assistant that suggests and completes comments/code in real time.

## Anaconda
1. The first thing we need to do is download and install Anaconda. This will get all the tools we need for Python and let us set up environments
    - Download link: https://www.anaconda.com/download/success

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to switch the **‘Download for Mac’ to Intel** with the dropdown arrow when at COAPS.

2. Once we get that installed, we should have a screen that looks like this

3. If you **click on ‘Environments’** on the left, and then **‘Create’ on the bottom left**, you can set up a new environment (name it whatever you want).

> [!TIP]
> It can take 20-30 second to load in, but should have something like this below

## Visual Studio Code
Now that we have Anaconda installed and our Python environment running, let's go get an IDE!

### Part 1: Installing Visual Studio Code
1. Go to the VS Code download page: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2. Under the macOS section, look for the x64 (Intel) options

> [!NOTE]
> You can choose the .zip file for a simple installation (recommended for most users) or the User/System Installer if you prefer a guided setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Download the x64 version to ensure compatibility with your Intel Mac.

3. Once downloaded, open your Downloads folder in Finder.
    - If you downloaded the .zip file, double-click it to extract the contents: this will give you the Visual Studio Code.app file
    - Drag the Visual Studio Code.app file to your Applications folder. You’re good to go!

### Part 2: Setting Up a Workspace and Terminal In VS Code
After launching visual studio code, there are a few things we need to do.

1. Let’s setup a workspace! This is essentially adding a directory for where our files will be located. This can be done via **File -> Add Folder to Workspace**
