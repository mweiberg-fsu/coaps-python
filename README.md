# COAPS Python Toolbelt & Tutorial
The COAPS Python Toolbelt & Tutorial is designed to get users up and running with a Python environment. Below is a list of software/IDEs that are considered industry standard. 

## Software Utilized
- **Anaconda** - Python distribution for data science with built-in package management.
- **Visual Studio Code** - Versatile code editor with debugging and extension support.
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive tool for writing and running code with visuals and notes.
- **GitHub Copilot** - AI assistant that suggests and completes comments/code in real time.

## Installing Anaconda
1. The first thing we need to do is download and install Anaconda. This will get all the tools we need for Python and let us set up environments
